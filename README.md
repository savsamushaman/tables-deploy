##Tables
(made with Django)

Tables is an application which wants to accomplish the simplification of ordering, buying and paying experience on customer and vendor side both.

My primary goal is to offer a smooth and simple experience to both the customer and the vendor aided by today's technology. First stop is the web, but I have plans to develop android and ios support for Tables.
